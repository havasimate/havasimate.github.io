          <h2>The Great War of the Dream SMP</h2>
          <p>
            On the 31st of July, 2020, Wilbur Soot started an independent nation
            on the Dream SMP. <br />
            Our story starts with a smol dog, who had a big idea. He decided to
            join the big dogs on the Dream SMP, and fill the soulless oak slabs
            of the Prime Path with meaning. <br />
            His plan was simple. Starting a drug empire, whitch gives work and
            purpose to the Tommyinnitses of the server – it was something that
            every resonable man would’ve done. However, in the process of
            creating the perfect drug empire, when the golden carrots, fermented
            spider eyes and everything nice were added, they accidentally added
            an extra ingredient to the concoction – Revolution.
            <br />
            thus, l’manberg was born <br />
            on 2nd august 2020, dream, the server’s owner started a war against
            l’manberg, after wilbur soot declared “independance” from the dream
            smp. <br />
            the war started with the battle of the power tower, which -
            unfortunately - the dream team won. when the l’manbergians realized
            that their war-winning words can’t win the war, the 5th battalion
            fought epic battles after epic battles against the tyrants (except
            maybe when the right-hand man pulled a ‘charles lee‘ during the
            battle of the embassy) – and they were about to win. <br />
            but then, one of the l’manbergians, he who must not be named,
            committed betrayal; he mumbled something about how the revolution
            wasn’t meant to happen or some shit like that then activated a trap
            (all right, the right-hand man activated the trap - well done, mr.
            innit) which ended up killing all the revolutionaries.
            <br />
            after a failed attempt at negotiations and blowing up half of
            l’manberg, wilbur was ready to talk about surrender. <br />
            tommy still tried to challenge dream to a xiaolin showdown. he
            summoned all the courage he required, looked dream in the eye, aimed
            no higher – but maybe he was distracted by the fact that dream’s
            eyes were on his chest or somethin’, ‘cause he lost the duel.

          at this stage, everything seemed to have been lost. until, tommy went
          into a one-on-one negotiation with dream, offering his precious discs
          in exchange for the independence of l’manberg
          <br />
          dream agreed to the terms and with that, tommy proved that the famous
          term ”words are our weapons” is true, and a war indeed can be won by
          them. <br />
          viva la revolución, viva l’manberg!
